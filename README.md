- Hello my name is Shaun Anderson and along with my wife we are founders and owners of Gate 7 Studios and we would like to tell you why you should invest in our vision . We have the potential to help poeople around the globe through song, art and information.  
- Im a Writer, singer and well for lack of better way of saying it an actor. I am also a licensed Sheetmetal Mechanic, 5 years of apprenticeship isnt an easy thing for an old man. my main interest right now is succeeding at what I do,
  and helping others achieve the same once I have reached a certain level of stability.
-  I’m currently learning the ins and outs of the internet and the community it supports. Not only the community but the mechanics and dynamics of a digital world and how it can be used to bring this world closer together.
- our goal is to establish a organization that will help independent artist,entruepenures and independent individuals seeking to self sustain. We have the ability to produce videos, music, and pretty much any type of media that would be appropriate. Although our main goal is to be able to proflessionaly do this ourfirst priority in helping others is to start a fund for Nerve Disease. My wife is going through this as we speak and we dont want to see people suffer through the same.

- My Artist name is The Devils Poet and I have released 26 songs over the last year.I only started doing music a year ago. I am an action taker and when we are able we accomplish amazing things. We also started a show Vandals Den which has sprouted off many different projects. So with that I would like to introduce Last Jeester Enterprises, a small studio with an enormous potential. We are globaly known on a small scale but with the right backing the potential to help change a world.
  We are a family of artistically talented people.
- We have a website being developed, well a couple of them ..lol with the potential to generate enough revenue to eventually support itself and anything more than we need well that goes into Nerve Disease research or somethin like that.
- I was trying to accomplish this on our own but in the end, things out of our control interfered. I have been looking for this place for a very long time.
- The best way to reach me is at: Gate7studios@gmail.com My wifes battle with this unknown nerve disease has been hell on her and we have watched our established lives fall apart before our eyes ,changing our view of the world. I can not walk away from what we built and Im looking for collaborators.financers and partners to help us finish what we have started. You have to have an opened mind though, our vision is influencing
, I can tell by the way it has influenced things around us.
